# movie-recommender-system
This project is a machine learning-based movie recommender system that recommends movies to users based on their interests. The recommender system is built using content-based filtering technique and cosine similarity metric.

## How to use the system
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd repo_name
3. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the web app: streamlit run app.py
5. The web app will open in your default browser. Enter a movie title in the search box, and the system will recommend similar movies based on cosine similarity.
